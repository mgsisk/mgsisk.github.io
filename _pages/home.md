I'm a designer, developer, and creator from Michigan with a passion for the web,
awful movies, and setting people on fire. Technically skilled, aesthetically
inclined, and inquisitive by nature, I pursue creative endeavors with my selkie
wife while working for a midwestern university during the day and
building death gauntlets for acrobatic plumbers at night.

If you’re reading this you may be familiar with Webcomic, a WordPress plugin I
created that helps people publish… uh, webcomics. Since 2008 I’ve spent a lot of
my free time supporting and continuing to develop Webcomic. It's a lot of fun!
It's also increasingly difficult to dedicate the time I’d like to these sorts of
projects.

Creating and continuing to support projects like Webcomic is a challenge. When I
started working on Webcomic I was an unemployed college graduate with lots of
free time; now I’m a doubly-employed husband and graduate student with very
little free time. In spite of the challenge I’d love to do more, not just with
Webcomic, but with other projects as well.

If you like what I create, please consider donating to my ongoing creative work.
Besides a level of thanks and gratitude directly proportional to your monetary
support, you’ll be providing ongoing validation and encouragement for my
creative efforts. I spend a lot of time working on projects like Webcomic, but
it's much easier to justify that time with feedback and support from patrons.
