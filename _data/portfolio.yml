    Launched as part of Western Michigan University's Esports@WMU initiative,
    the wmuesports.com website provided news and information about the exciting
    new campus project. As one of the co-authors of and implementation team
    members for the initiative, I was tasked with creating and implementing the
    new website based on existing University branding standards.

    Created by MD Mortem, King of the Unknown is "a rock-powered series that's
    equal parts supernatural horror, raunchy comedy, action epic, and
    all-you-can-eat conspiracy theory buffet." I worked with MD to redesign the
    previous King of the Unknown website that I had also designed and
    developed. For this redesign MD provided the basic design concepts and art
    that I implemented in a custom-built WordPress theme.

    An annual fundraising event for over a decade, the Kalamazoo Hot Dog Walk is
    "all about having fun, making new friends, sampling great food and helping
    those in need in our community." I've worked closely with the "DogFathers"
    during that time, creating the Walk's logo, designing some of the Walk's
    T-shirts, and custom-building the web site that builds anticipation for the
    event and powers annual Walk registrations.

    Created for the Bridgman Public Schools Lego League team, the Astronaut
    Family Album is a concept application. The app contains a collection of
    items (photos, videos, text, etc.) which unlock after a fixed amount of
    time. Astronauts would take the app into space with them and check it
    periodically to receive new memories from home. I met with Bridgman's 4th
    Grade Lego League team to work out their concept for the app, then designed
    and built it, with minor refinement, to their specifications.

    The Biosciences Research and Commercialization Center of Western Michigan
    University "provides startup and gap funding to promising Michigan-based
    life sciences and medical device ventures entering the commercialization
    phase of development." I worked with the BRCC as an independent creative
    consultant to redesign their aging website and give it a clean, modern,
    single-page redesign. WordPress was used to allow BRCC staff to easily
    update the site.

    Enter the House of Discipline! USA Tae Kwon Do is a local Kalamazoo, MI
    business dedicated to "helping people build self-confidence, self-esteem,
    and learn self-defense while getting fit, losing weight, and having fun." I
    worked with Grand Master M'Hammad to redesign his existing web presence
    using a custom-built WordPress theme, with a specific focus on sharing
    information about the dojang and upcomming events.

    Webcomic is a plugin for WordPress that provides a host of features related
    to creating, managing, and sharing comics on the web. I originally created
    Webcomic in 2008, and have continued to develop and support it ever since.
    Webcomic works with any WordPress theme, but I also developed Inkblot -- a
    theme built specifically for use with the Webcomic plugin -- to help
    webcomic authors get their sites up quickly and share their work with the
    world.

    Hazard is a tiny web application for creating Jeopardy-style quizzes. Using
    basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, Hazard allows a user to create any number
    of quizzes with multiple rounds, categories, questions, point values,
    timers, players, and more. Quizzes are saved locally using the Web Storage
    API and can be backed up and imported into other browsers. Created as the
    final project of an Educational Technology masters course on gamification,
    Hazard was an interesting challenge in creating a self-contained web app
    with classroom applications.
